# The-Maze-Runner
This is the solution os a test a teacher gave me to solve.

The maze is an array of characters where we need to find the exit without going through the walls and without going outside the bounds of the array. 
The conditional structure must be designed to find the exit from the maze regardless of how many times the maze is changed manually, as long as the maze has a solution.
